Laravel: change public html to public_html, the right way
then go to your public_html/index.php and add, just after the line where 
$app is created:

$app->bind('path.public', function() {
    return __DIR__;
});
this will bind the document root to he current file path, where index.php exists
also, to fix the path for scripts used in CLI mode or Artisan script, you should add the code below to the 
file /bootstrap/app.php

$app->bind('path.public', function() {
    return base_path().'/public_html';
});

HOW TO CLEAR CACHE USING BROWSER TO TRIGGER artisan command

Most of the shared hosting providers donâ€™t provide SSH access to the systems. In that case, you can 
clear Laravel cache by calling URL in the browser. You can simply place the below code in your 
routes/web.php file of Laravel application. Then access this URL in the browser to clear the cache of 
Laravel application.

Route::get('/clear-cache', function() {
    Artisan::call('cache:clear');
    return "Cache is cleared";
});
Clear Config
Route::get('/clear-cache', function() {
    Artisan::call('config:cache');
    return "Config Cache is cleared";
});

SHARED HOSTING file path
is_dir(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(D:\Proyectos\Miproyecto\resources\views/vendor/notifications) is not 
within the allowed path(s): (C:/Inetpub/vhosts//clubhuellas.com;C:\Windows\Temp)
Solution: go to folder bootstrap/cache and rename config.php to anything you want and reload site.
